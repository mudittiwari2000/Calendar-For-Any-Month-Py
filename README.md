# Calendar-For-Any-Month-Py
Project made to take month(1 - 12) and year (1800 - 2099) as an input to output a calendar for that month of the year.

Steps to get it working:

- <b>Step-1</b>: Clone the repository in your PC, and make sure you download the "utility.py" so no errors are shown while compiling.

- <b>Step-2</b>: If you do not already have "simple_colors" installed, install it by writing "python -m pip install -u simple_colors" or "pip               install simple_colors" in your Python Shell/Command Prompt/PowerShell or even Visual Studio Code terminal.
